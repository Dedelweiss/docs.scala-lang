Thank you for wanting to contribute to Scala 3!

This chapter introduces instructions
on how to do basic tasks when fixing compiler issues. The tasks include:
- how to [reproduce an issue][reproduce]
- how to [navigate to where the issue manifests][navigation] itself in the compiler
- How to [debug the compiler][debugging]
- But also some other [debugging techniques][other-debugging]
- find shortcuts to [common issue areas][areas] of the compiler
- how to [inspect various values][inspection] encountered in the compiler
- how to [create a test][testing] for your fix.

You can find the instructions of how to do the above in the following sections of this guide.

[reproduce]: {% link _overviews/scala3-contribution/procedures-reproduce.md %}
[navigation]: {% link _overviews/scala3-contribution/procedures-navigation.md %}
[areas]: {% link _overviews/scala3-contribution/procedures-areas.md %}
[inspection]: {% link _overviews/scala3-contribution/procedures-inspection.md %}
[testing]: {% link _overviews/scala3-contribution/procedures-testing.md %}
[debugging]: {% link _overviews/scala3-contribution/procedures-debugging.md %}
[other-debugging]: {% link _overviews/scala3-contribution/procedures-other-debugging.md %}
